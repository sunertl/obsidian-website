## Personal Notes

- 2023-12-06
	- Day 6 of my Advent calendar
	- It really hits you right away when you open the bag, the sweetness is uncanny
	- You smell honey right away, but what was weird is that I smelled baked apple. This is such a curve ball but it was awesome to have identified it
	- The grind is very fine which makes it a bit acidic at first
	- Overall, great coffee! Would order more!
