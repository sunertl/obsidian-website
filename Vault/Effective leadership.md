The impact of effective leaders can be measured by greater outcomes generated by a group of people ([[Compound effect]]).

A great team will usually achieve great outcomes. This can be achieved by the fact that leaders need to belief in the overall mission and end goal of a project. This is the foundation that the team members need to see. If there is doubt, the leader needs to ask questions at his management and tell the team the results/deviations of previous expactions. ([[Purposeful leadership]])

People should feel that they can share their mistakes - base respect on the person, not on performance ([[Authentic leadership]]).
