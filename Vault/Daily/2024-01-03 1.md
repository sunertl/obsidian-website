[[2024-01 - Trip to Italy]]
Arrived in Italy yesterday
Had dinner at the hotel

Today, went to see [[Cafezal Torrefazione Milano]] (a speciality coffee roaster) and had a Geisha coffee for the first time

It was probably the smoothest coffee I've ever had, 10/10

Had a savory croissant with cream cheese and prosciutto for breakfast 

Went to the Duomo and also saw the Scala - Scala is underwhelming

Stopped by at a shopping mall (Rinascente) and had pizza and water![[IMG_2976.jpeg]]

Went to the Rimowa store and got an L suitcase

Stopped by at [[Marchesi]] and got an espresso with a fun hat to keep it warm and a toasted Panetone with Vanilla cream

Had an amazing experience at Alessandro Squarzi's clothing store ([[Fortela Store Milano]]), bought a fun vest, a beautiful unique sports jacket and my first Japanese denim jeans.

Dinner at [[Il Piccolo]] - first time Ossobucco!
