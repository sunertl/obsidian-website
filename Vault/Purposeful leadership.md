Leaders need to belief in the overall mission and end goal of a project. This is the foundation that the team members need to see. If there is doubt, the leader needs to ask questions at his management and tell the team the results/deviations of previous expactions.

If the purpose is not clearly defined, you'll find conflicts or mismatched expectations.

Team needs to know and understand what success looks like.
