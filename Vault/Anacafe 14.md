# Background

Anacafe 14 is supposed to have originated from a natural cross between a Catimor variety (Timor Hybrid and [[Caturra]]) and [[Pacamara]] around 1980, in the Department of Chiquimula, Guatemala. It was discovered by farmer Francisco Manchamé. After several cycles of mass selection, in which a group of individual plants are selected based on their superior performance, and then seed from these plants is bulked to form a new generation. and genealogical selection by the National Coffee Association of Guatemala (ANACAFÉ), it was released as a commercial variety in 2014.
