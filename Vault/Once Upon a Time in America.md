## Synopsis

A former Prohibition-era Jewish gangster returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan 35 years later, where he must once again confront the ghosts and regrets of his old life.

## Personal notes

Watched the remastered edition that [[Martin Scorsese]] worked on with the help of Leone's children on the plane back from [[2024-01 - Trip to Italy|Italy]] in January 2024. Movie was almost 4.5hrs long and I was captivated the entire time.
