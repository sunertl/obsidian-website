## Synopsis

It follows a team of journalists traveling across the United States during a civil war fought between an authoritarian federal government and several regional factions.


## Personal Notes

Pretty disappointed overall - I felt I was cat-fished. I honestly thought that the movie was more focused on the politics causing the civil war and less so about a story following journalists traveling through civil-war-torn America.

I felt lost throughout the entirety of the movie. What was the actual point of it?
