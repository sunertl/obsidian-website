## Synopsis

After finding an old rifle, a young boy joins the Soviet resistance movement against ruthless German forces and experiences the horrors of World War II.

## Personal Notes

A surreal movie - I didn't fully comprehend all the themes yet, so I have to rewatch it again. Overall, one of the most intense WWII movies I have ever seen. I could feel the hopelessness and the fear in the boy's eyes throughout the movie. I was part of his emotions.
