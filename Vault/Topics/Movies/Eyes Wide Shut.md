## Synopsis

A Manhattan doctor embarks on a bizarre, night-long odyssey after his wife's admission of unfulfilled longing.

## Personal Notes

Recently watched the movie with Catherine after a long time again and didn't even realize it was based on Arthur Schnitzler's [[Traumnovelle]]. 

This movie is about missed opportunities and male fantasies - I found it particularly intriguing that the doctor's wife's sexual fantasies are just fantasies and did not even happen in reality. She was just fantasizing about an affair she had with a Navy officer. Throughout the movie, we are presented with short flashbacks of her memories. 

The doctor does not like that.

Once he heard her sharing her fantasies with him, he is set loose. He is going down the rabbit hole of a drug-like journey of trying to get an even stronger dose as the one before - a dose of trying to get revenge at his wife. 

He meets a hooker, but doesn't have sex. Goes to a bar where he meets an old fried who tells him about this secretive club outside of the city. The club hosts an event where everyone is wearing a mask. Inside, he sees orgies, people watching other people having sex, etc. but he isn't doing anything. 

We see continuous flashbacks of his wife's fantasies as a reminder that they are just that, not reality. However, we see the doctor being part of observing situations that could lead and make fantasies into realities, but it doesn't happen either. 

We are joining a man's ride of almost fulfilled sexual fantasies, but are reminded that they don't mean anything, such as his wife's.
