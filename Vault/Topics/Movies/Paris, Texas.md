## Synopsis
Travis Henderson, an aimless drifter who has been missing for four years, wanders out of the desert and must reconnect with society, himself, his life, and his family.

## Personal Notes

Beautiful piece of art - cinematography, score, acting all was just sublime. It is a very layered movie, with some downtime to reflect.

The score that played during the scene where all watch old tapes from Travis, Jann, Hunter and Travis' brother and wife was perfect.
