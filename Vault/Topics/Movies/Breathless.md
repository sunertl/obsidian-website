## Synopsis

A small-time thief steals a car and impulsively murders a motorcycle policeman. Wanted by the authorities, he reunites with a hip American journalism student and attempts to persuade her to run away with him to Italy.

## Personal Notes

A fantastic movie, shot in a very specific manner - everything happens very fast 

Crazy story about Jean Seberg I read while watching the movie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Seberg
