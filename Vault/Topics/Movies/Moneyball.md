# Synopsis

The central premise ofÂ _Moneyball_Â is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and theÂ front office over the past century is outdated, subjective, and often flawed. Statistics such asÂ stolen bases,Â runs batted in, andÂ batting average typically used to gauge players, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game and the statistics available at that time. Before sabermetrics was introduced to baseball, teams were dependent on the skills of their scouts to find and evaluate players. Scouts are experienced in the sport, usually having been players or coaches. The book argues that the Oakland A's' front office took advantage of more analytical gauges of player performance to field a team that could outsmart and better compete against richer competitors inÂ Major League Baseball.

Rigorous statistical analysis had demonstrated thatÂ [on-base percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage "On-base percentage")Â andÂ [slugging percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage "Slugging percentage")Â are better indicators of offensive success, and the A's became convinced that these qualities were cheaper to obtain on the open market than more historically valued qualities such as running speed and defense. These observations often flew in the face of conventional baseball wisdom and the beliefs of many baseball scouts and executives.

By re-evaluating their strategy in this way, theÂ [2002 Athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Oakland_Athletics_season "2002 Oakland Athletics season"), with approximately $44 million in salary, were competitive with larger market teams such as theÂ [New York Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees "New York Yankees"), who spent over $125 million in payroll that season. Because of its smaller budget, Oakland had to find players undervalued by the market, and their system has proven itself thus far. The approach brought the A's to the playoffs in 2002 and 2003.

Lewis explored several themes in the book, such as insiders vs. outsiders (established traditionalists vs. upstart proponents ofÂ [sabermetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics "Sabermetrics")), the democratization of information causing a flattening of hierarchies, and "the ruthless drive for efficiency thatÂ [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism")Â demands".

_Moneyball_Â also touches on the A's' methods of prospect selection. Sabermetricians argue that aÂ [college baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_baseball "College baseball")Â player's chance of MLB success is much higher than the more traditional high school draft pick. Beane maintains that high draft picks spent on high school prospects, regardless of talent or physical potential as evaluated by traditional scouting, are riskier than those spent on more polished college players. Adding on, college players have played more games and thus there is a larger mass of statistical data to base expensive decisions off. Lewis cites A's minor leaguerÂ [Jeremy Bonderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bonderman "Jeremy Bonderman"), drafted out of high school in 2001 over Beane's objections, as an example of the type of draft pick Beane would avoid. Bonderman had all of the traditional "tools" that scouts look for, but thousands of such players have been signed by MLB organizations out of high school over the years and failed to develop as anticipated. Lewis explores the A's approach to theÂ [2002 MLB draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Major_League_Baseball_draft "2002 Major League Baseball draft"), when the team had a run of early picks. The book documents Beane's often tense discussions with his scouting staff (who favored traditional subjective evaluation of potential rather than objective sabermetrics) in preparation for the draft to the actual draft, which defied all expectations and was considered at the time a wildly successful (if unorthodox) effort by Beane.

_Moneyball_Â traces the history of the sabermetric movement back to such people asÂ [Bill James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_James "Bill James")Â (then a member of theÂ [Boston Red Sox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox)Â [front office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_office_(sports) "Front office (sports)")) andÂ [Craig R. Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_R._Wright "Craig R. Wright"). Lewis explores how James's seminalÂ _[Baseball Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_Abstract "Baseball Abstract")_, published annually from the late 1970s through the late 1980s, influenced many of the young, up-and-coming baseball minds that are now joining the ranks of baseball management.
