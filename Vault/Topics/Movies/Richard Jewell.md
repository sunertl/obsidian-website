## Synopsis
Security guard Richard Jewell is an instant hero after foiling a bomb attack at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but his life becomes a nightmare when the FBI leaks to the media that he is a suspect in the case.

## Thoughts

I believe that Clint Eastwood as a director is better than people think. I didn't particularly like [[American Sniper]] - I think it was a propaganda/psy-ops piece perpetuating the forever war. 

However and similarly to [[Grand Torino]], the way he makes use of situations of everyday lives resonates with me. Acting in all his movies as a director is top notch - casting is amazing, such as Richard Jewell.
