## Synopsis

After refusing to attack an enemy position, a general accuses the soldiers of cowardice and their commanding officer must defend them.

## Personal Notes

Pretty boring movie? Did not really see the appeal in this one. I understand the premise, but what's the underlying message here? That war is bad? That there is insanity, cruelty and amorality? I wasn't sold. My least favorite Kubrick.
