## Synopsis

An angel tires of his purely ethereal life of merely overseeing the human activity of Berlin's residents, and longs for the tangible joys of physical existence when he falls in love with a mortal.


## Personal Notes

I liked the movie a lot - someone described this movie as a true German film which resonated with me since a lot of imagery and inner monologues tackled German struggles - the war and the separation between West and East. The inner monolgues opened up a world of anger, fear and emotions to an audience which were never overtly spoken of.
