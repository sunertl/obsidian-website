# Plot

A Victorian surgeon rescues a heavily disfigured man who is mistreated while scraping a living as a side-show freak. Behind his monstrous fa√ßade, there is revealed a person of kindness, intelligence and sophistication.

# Thoughts

This Lynch movie is much more accessable than his other works. I was so surprised that Anthony Hopkins had a major role in this movie. 

It came out 1980 but it felt like a 40s or 50s movie. 

Interesting dynamic between Bytes (John Merrick's "owner") and Teves (the doctor who treats him). Bytes wants to own him for profit, Teves has supposedly more humanistic approach, but struggles at some point because he's given the high society a chance to see him - similar to Bytes?

Beautiful story of a man who has never gotten a fair chance by a cruel society.
