## Synopsis

A mentally unstable veteran works as a nighttime taxi driver in New York City, where the perceived decadence and sleaze fuels his urge for violent action.

## Personal Notes

One of my favorite movies! Great acting, cinematography - the story is similar to what I perceive a guy who believes in Red Pill does.

Can't imagine the outrage this movie has caused when it came out - the violence or Jodie Foster playing a child prostitute (she was 13 in the movie)

I read somewhere that the movie was supposed to feel like a dream - when you look at some of the scenes when Travis is driving his taxi during the night, all the billboards, traffic lights - these aren't seen in a sharp light. It's blurry, it's rainy, etc. - you can also see that when you look at Travis. He's sleepy most of the time.
