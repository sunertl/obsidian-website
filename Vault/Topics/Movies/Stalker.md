## Synopsis

A hired guide—the Stalker—leads a writer and a professor into the heart of the Zone, the restricted site of a long-ago disaster, where the three men eventually zero in on the Room, a place rumored to fulfill one’s most deeply held desires. Adapting a science-fiction novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Tarkovsky created an immersive world with a wealth of material detail and a sense of organic atmosphere. A religious allegory, a reflection of contemporaneous political anxieties, a meditation on film itself.

## Personal Notes

I loved the movie - it is an allegory that man's most wanted desires are actually not desirable in the end. Do we want to be happy? Do we want to have a fulfilled life? The movie asks these questions and the Stalker's wife gives an answer: no, we'd rather live a happy life in an imperfect world than a fulfilled life in a boring world. 

Need to watch this movie again to fully capture all the details. It's a long movie and I had to watch it in multiple sittings.
