# Plot
___

A linguist works with the military to communicate with alien lifeforms after twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world.


# Thoughts
___
A truly unique and masterfully crafted cinematic experience, I have never seen anything like that before. 
Aliens arrive at the Earth and communicate with humans through clouds in circular shapes. Each shape symbolizes a thought/sentence. Amy Adams is deciphering that but has constant flashbacks which the viewer is not able to understand at this point yet. The world is on the brink of war, but at the latest hour, she'll understand what the aliens are telling us: they'll give us 'weapons', these weapons are the ability to see in the future. The aliens need help from us in the future, so they'll give these weapons to humans to understand potentially how we can help them.

A fantastic and unique story paired with absolutely amazing actors. Cinematography top notch, score as well. Will probably watch again!
