## Synopsis

Biographical epic of the controversial and influential Black Nationalist leader, from his early life and career as a small-time gangster, to his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam.


## Personal Notes

Malcolm X's politics was completely opposed to the [[American Zeitgeist]] and was pretty much a fringe politician / activist in American society.

The portrayal of Malcolm X hasn't been very critical - he was apparently a staunch antisemite, nothing was mentioned during the movie. 

I kept thinking about [[A People's History of the United States]] where the main theme was that [[Racism is a tool of the powerful to separate races by a screen of racial contempt]] - Malcolm X used the same logic against White people. He actually became a powerful tool for the powerful - he nurtured the racial divide, used [[Islam]] as his main ideological foundation almost, a religion that has no history in the US. It didn't make much sense and was therefore seen mostly as an outcast. MLK was more powerful than him.

Good movie though! Great acting from [[Denzel Washington]] and rest.
