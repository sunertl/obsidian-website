>Focal length determines how "zoomed" in you are - also often called 'angle of view'.

## Overview

A focal length is usually expressed in millimeters, and you should be aware that the resulting angle of view actually depends on the size of the sensor of the camera on which the lens is used (this is called the crop factor). 
For this reason, we often give “35mm equivalent” focal lengths, which is the focal length that would offer the same view on a 35mm camera (the historic film SLR format) and allows us to make meaningful comparisons. If there is a single length (e.g. 24mm), then the lens doesn’t zoom, and it is often called a [[Prime Lens|prime lens]]. If there are two numbers (e.g. 18-55mm), then you can use the lens at any focal in that range. Compact cameras often don’t give focal lengths but simply the range, for instance 8x. This means that the long end is 8 times longer than the wide one, so the lens could for instance be a 18-144mm, or a 35-280mm, etc.

## Focal Ranges

- **Ultra-wide angle – 14-24mm**: They are pretty specialized lenses as they will tend to exaggerate perspective to levels which can easily be disturbing. Our eyes are not used to such wide angles of view, and they will look unnatural, which can be used for artistic purposes. Landscape and architecture photographers love these focals as they will create a lot of depth and emphasize perspective.

- **Wide angle – 24-35mm**: Wide enough to show a lot of context, but not so wide that they look unnatural, they were used a lot by photojournalists. It is a good “default” focal range, which explains why most kit lenses include them (18-xx lenses on DX DSLRs, for instance).

- **Normal – 40-75mm**: What exact length a normal lens should be has been subject to a lot of debate, but it is estimated to be around 45mm. This is an angle of view which looks very natural and “inoffensive”, neither too wide nor too tele. It also corresponds more or less to the focal length we actually perceive (though due to peripheral vision, our eyes have an estimated 22mm focal). Street photographers love these lengths.

- **Mild tele – 85-105mm**: This is prime portrait category: long enough to isolate the face and create separation from the background (through shallow depth of field, more on this in another lesson) but short enough that you can still be within communicating distance from your subject.

- **Medium tele – 120-300mm**: Just like wide angle, this is very polyvalent focal length which can be used in most genre to isolate details and simplify compositions. For landscape work, remember about the “perspective flattening” effect.

- **Long and exotic tele – 300-800mm**: Those are specialized lenses for wildlife and sport photographers who need to get close to their subjects but can’t physically move. They are complex and very expensive lenses, and their angle of view is so narrow that it won’t be of much use to most photographers. Tripods and fat wallets are often required.
