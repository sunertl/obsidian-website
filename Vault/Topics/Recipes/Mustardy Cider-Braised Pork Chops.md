## Ingredients

- 4 1½"-thick bone-in rib pork chops (about 2 lb. total)
- 3 Tbsp. sugar
- 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
- 1 Tbsp. freshly ground pepper, plus more 
- 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil 
- 3 medium Granny Smith or Gala apples, halved through equators
- 3 medium shallots, peeled, halved lengthwise through root ends
- 4 garlic cloves, finely grated
- ¼ cup Dijon mustard 
- 3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
- 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter
- 2 cups sweet hard apple cider (such as Angry Orchard)
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar
- 10–12 sprigs thyme, tied together with kitchen twine
- Finely chopped chives (for serving)

## Directions

#### Step 1

Pat **four 1½"-thick bone-in rib pork chops (about 2 lb. total)** dry with paper towels. Sprinkle all over with **3 Tbsp. sugar**, **1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt**, and **1 Tbsp. freshly ground pepper**. Heat **2 Tbsp. vegetable oil** in a large cast-iron skillet over high. Working in batches if needed, cook pork chops, turning halfway through, until deeply browned, about 5 minutes total. Transfer to a large plate.

#### Step 2

Working in batches if needed, cook **3 medium Granny Smith or Gala apples, halved through equators**, and **3 medium shallots, peeled, halved lengthwise through root ends**, cut sides down, in same skillet, gently pressing down on them with a spatula to create contact with pan, until golden brown on cut sides, about 2 minutes (it’s okay if shallots fall apart). Transfer apples to plate with chops.

#### Step 3

Reduce heat to medium, add **4 garlic cloves, finely grated**, to pan, and cook, stirring constantly, just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add **¼ cup Dijon mustard**, **3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour**, and **2 Tbsp. unsalted butter**; stir to coat shallots. Pour in **2 cups sweet hard apple cider**, **1 cup low-sodium chicken broth**, and **1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar**, scraping up browned bits and flour stuck to bottom of pan and incorporating into liquid. Add **10–12 sprigs thyme, tied together with kitchen twine**, and bring mixture to a simmer. Partially cover (use a baking sheet if you don’t have a lid) and simmer until sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

#### Step 4

Place pork chops and apples in sauce, arranging apples cut sides up, and partially cover. Simmer until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a pork chop registers 145°, 7–10 minutes. Remove from heat; sprinkle with **finely chopped chives** and season with more pepper to serve.

## Notes

- Be careful searing meat when coated in sugar - caramalizes in the pan quickly and leads to burnt spots.
- Sauce could've reduced a bit longer, but overall was very creamy. 
- Go easy on the apple cider vinegar - I was worried that the sauce tasted too much like vinegar, but was fine at the end. Stick to the recipe.
- Might go well with (mashed) potatoes
