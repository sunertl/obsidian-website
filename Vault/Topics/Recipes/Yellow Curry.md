- 1 small vellow onion chopped
-  ¾ pound chicken breast cubed
-  1 tablespoon neutral oil canola works well
-  5 tbsp yellow curry 
-  ¼ pound baby yukon gold potatoes halved
-  14 oz coconut milk
-  ¾ cup heavy cream
-  1 medium head of broccoli chopped
-  ½ red pepper julienned
-  1½ cup fresh pineapple cubed
-  2 teaspoons fish sauce
-  3 tablespoons brown sugar
-  Juice from ½ lime
-  Kosher salt to taste

## Directions

1. Start the rice as per package instructions. It will cook while the sauce simmers.
2. Preheat a large skillet with deep sides or a dutch oven over medium heat.
3. Chop the yellow onion and cube up the chicken breasts. Ensure the chicken is in similar sized pieces to ensure they cook evenly.
4. Once the pan is preheated, add in the oil and chopped onions. Allow the onions to cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes until fragrant. The onions should not be taking on any color
5. Add the cubed chicken and yellow curry paste into the skillet. Toss the chicken and onions until covered by the yellow curry paste. Saute for 3-4 minutes.
6. While chicken is cooking, cut the baby yukon gold potatoes in half.
7. After the chicken has been cooking for 3-4 minutes, add in the potatoes, coconut milk and heavy cream. Stir well to combine. The sauce should be a pale yellow color and milk like consistency 
8. Allow this mixture to come to a simmer for 20-30 minutes uncovered until chicken and potatoes are cooked through. Potatoes will be fork tender when they are done cooking
9. While the curry is simmering, chop up the broccoli, julienne the red bell pepper and chop up the pineapple.
10. After the potatoes and chicken are cooked, add in the cut up broccoli and red peppers. Allow everything to simmer together for 2-3 minutes until the broccoli has softened.
11. Turn off the heat and add in the pineapple, fish sauce and brown sugar. Squeeze the juice from half a lime over the curry and stir to combine. Season with salt and more lime juice to taste.
12. Portion out rice and add the curry over the top and enjoy.
