### Leadership Principles

The book contains several leadership principles that center around the core principle - [[Extreme ownership]]. These principles are tailored for combat/war missions, but removing yourself from the details, it allows you to see the big picture on how leaders should behave and what characteristics they should have in order to lead successful teams. 

Overall great insights once you look at it from a bird's eye view perspective.
