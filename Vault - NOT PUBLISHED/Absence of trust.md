Absence of trust means that team members don't feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable. Vulnerability (in this sense) means that they don't feel that they can make mistakes because they fear the repercussions of them / or feel that honesty will be used against them.

Other types vulnerabilities that are part of this:
- weaknesses
- skill deficiencies
- interpersonal shortcomings
- mistakes
- requests for help

As soon as people feel more comfortable, they can focus their energy on the job at hand.

It is also the team leader's responsibility to lead as an example and allow that behavior by showing vulnerability as well ([[Authentic leadership]] + [[Authenticity creates a safer work environment]] + [[Authenticity builds better relationships with teams]]).
