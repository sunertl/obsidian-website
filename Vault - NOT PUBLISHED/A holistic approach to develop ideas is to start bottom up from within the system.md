#fleeting 

We start our intellectual endeavors with preconceptions that can be transformed during further inquiries and can serve as a starting point for following endeavors. This is also called aÂ [[Hermeneutic Circle]] 

By focusing on what is interesting and writing down your own intellectual development, topics, questions and arguments will emerge from the material without force. 

Once we see a critical mass of notes and clusters emerging from those notes, we see topics that can be built upon, but also topics we have already worked on.

[[The act of writing everything down is the deliberate practice of becoming better at what we are doing]]
