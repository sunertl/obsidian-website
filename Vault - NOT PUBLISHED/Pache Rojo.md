[[Coffee Collection]]

# Background
A natural mutation of the [[Typica]] variety related to a single gene that causes the plant to grow smaller (_dwarfism_), which allows it to be planted more densely and achieve higher yields. The variety was discovered in 1949 in Guatemala on the Brito farm in Santa Cruz Naranjo, Santa Rosa. From there it was selected by mass selection, meaning that a group of individuals are selected based on their superior performance, seed from these plants is bulked to form a new generation, and then the process is repeated. Mass selection took place across private farms in Guatemala, and from there spread to other regions and countries.
