#fleeting 

## Main Reasons

1. Created unified fields of exchange and communication below Latin and above the spoken vernaculars. People that spoke the same language were now also able to understand each other in print. 
2. Print-capitalism gave a new fixity to language which in the long run helped to build the image of antiquity so central to the subjective idea of the nation / Print capitalism gave a new fixity to language previously unattainable in the era of copied manuscript
3. Created languages-of-power in administrative vernaculars, which Anderson sees as first being a fortuitous alignment of capitalism, technology, and linguistic diversity, only later being manipulated or “exploited in a Machiavellian spirit”
