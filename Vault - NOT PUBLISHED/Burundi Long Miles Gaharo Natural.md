## Personal Notes

- 2023-12-18
	- Day 18 of the advent calendar
	- Video on their HP said it's an 'approachable' coffee - interesting way of saying it tastes boring
	- Didn't like it at all, was just not enough flavor
	- I can see it though that it's a good starter coffee
	- It's the same coffee as [[Burundi Long Miles Gaharo Hill]] but this one is naturally processed.
