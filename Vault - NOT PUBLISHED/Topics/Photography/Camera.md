>A device which can record light. It does so by focusing light on a photosensitive surface.

The photosensitive surface reacts to light through either a chemical process (film) or an electric one (digital sensor): they are a grid of several million tiny dots (pixels) and each can remember how much light it received in a given period of time. There are three important qualities to each [[Image Sensor|sensor]]: [[Display Resolution|resolution]], [[Size of a Sensor|size]] and what we can call “[[Sensor Quality|quality]]”.

The [[Camera Lens|lens]] is the second component of any camera. It is an optical device which takes scattered light rays and focuses them neatly on the sensor. Lenses are often complex, with up to 15 different optical elements serving different roles. The quality of the glass and the precision of the lens will be extremely important in determining how good the final image is.

The [[Camera Body|body]] is the light tight box connecting the lens to the sensor, and ordering everyone around. Though some film cameras are just that, black boxes, most digital cameras are now small computers, sporting all sorts of features, often of dubious usefulness.

There are several different types of cameras, arguably [[DSLR|DSLRs]] and [[Mirrorless Camera|Mirrorless]] the most important ones for serious photography.
