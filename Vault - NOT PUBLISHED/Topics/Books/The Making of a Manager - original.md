### Feedback

An area that talks about how to connect with your team in order for them to give actionable, fact-based feedback. Sometimes, behavioral feedback can be given, but needs to be tailored.

- [[Effective feedback]]
	- it's a skill that needs to be developed and trained
	- often times, people get too personal
	- it absolutely needs to be fact-based - only give behavioral feedback when it supplements the fact-based feedback given earlier
### Leadership

- [[Effective leadership]]
	- Hard to measure but there is the [[Compound effect]]
	- [[Extreme ownership]]
	- Similar to giving feedback, leadership is not something that can be bestowed
	- Relationships with teams need to be founded on trust so teams can be set up for success
	- Evaluation happens by the present (outcomes) and by the future (successes)
	- [[Purposeful leadership]]
		- Without clearly defined purpose, the team doesn't understand what they are working towards
- [[Authentic leadership]]
	- being yourself helps building trust
- [[Effective coordination]]
	- essentially team work
