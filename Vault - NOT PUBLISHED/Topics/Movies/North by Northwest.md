## Synopsis

A New York City advertising executive goes on the run after being mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies, and falls for a woman whose loyalties he begins to doubt.

## Personal Notes

It's definitely one of my favorite movies - I am a huge fan of Cary Grant and his fun approach to acting. It seems like a play to him, a way to communicate with his audience.

In addition, the story is just perfectly narrated and captivates the viewer.
