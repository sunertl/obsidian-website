## Synopsis
24 hours in the lives of three young men in the French suburbs the day after a violent riot.

## Personal Notes

- The pace is very fast - a lot of (sometimes horrible things) happen - you are starting to process one thing and suddenly it jumps to the next one
- Black and white
- great acting
- you can sense the social conflicts throughout
- It's interesting because the movie makes you think why people in the suburbs in poor neighborhoods don't break free. The whole movie shows that whatever they are doing, they are failing. The final scene is telling, because even though their friend is being killed by police, they shoot the police officer, repeating the vicious cycle they are trapped in
