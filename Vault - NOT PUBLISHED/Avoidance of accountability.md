Teams need to know what is expected from them in order for them to keep others accountable. 

Related to the concept of [[Extreme ownership]] - but it's important to understand that you can only enable team members to hold others accountable if
- people are allowed to be vulnerable ([[Absence of trust]])
- people are encouraged to have purposeful conflicts ([[Fear of conflict]])

Do this:

- Goals and standards need to be clearly defined
- Regular progress reviews/1-1s
- give out rewards for the team not the individuals

Accountability must be instilled in the individual as well - so it's not entirely the case that the team leader needs to follow [[Extreme ownership]], but actually needs to empower the individuals to follow [[Extreme ownership]].
