Welcome!

I created this site to publish my notes on various projects I've been working. My notes are all created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - a simple, yet powerful note-taking app based on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

This type of website is often referred to as a *digital garden*, a place that consists of ideas that grow over time - it's a reflection of what one has been, done, and learnt.
