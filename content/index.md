Welcome!

Thanks for visiting my site! This is my own and curated place on the Internet. This type of website is often referred to as a *digital garden*, a place that consists of ideas that grow over time - it's a reflection of what one has been, done, and learnt.

I created this site to publish my notes on various projects I've been working on and experiences I've gained over the last couple of years. My notes are all created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - a simple, yet powerful note-taking app based on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and are published with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

I subscribe to the idea that entropy and unstructured formats foster an environment for new ideas, that's why you'll see my notes in a non-hierarchal order and more cross-references - often called *networked thoughts*.

Feel free to browse around and see what I am currently studying, [[Bookshelf|reading]] or [[Movie Collection|watching]].
