## Personal Notes

- 2023-12-01:
	- this was the coffee in day 1 of my advent's calendar from Onyx
	- I followed the recipe very closely and it was a beautiful cup - very smooth, I could definitely taste the cocoa
	- Beautiful coffee, would order more
	- Drain took longer than 3:40 - more than 4 minutes
		- TIL - I should've stopped at 3:40!
