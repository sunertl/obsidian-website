> **Coffea arabica** (), also known as the Arabic coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the coffee and madder family Rubiaceae. It is believed to be the first species of coffee to have been cultivated and is currently the dominant cultivar, representing about 60% of global production. Coffee produced from the less acidic, more bitter, and more highly caffeinated robusta bean (C. canephora) makes up most of the remaining coffee production. Arabica coffee originates from and was first cultivated in Yemen, and documented by the 12th century. Coffea arabica is called ‏بُنّ‎ (būnn) in Arabic, borrowed from the Amharic  "Buna".

Historical records indicate that coffee seeds were taken from the coffee forests of Southwestern Ethiopia to Yemen, where it was cultivated as a crop. Recent genetic tests have confirmed that Bourbon and Typica were the main seeds taken from Ethiopia to Yemen. From Yemen, descendants of Bourbon and Typica spread around the world, forming the basis of modern arabica coffee cultivation
