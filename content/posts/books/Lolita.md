# Reflection/Review

I was conflicted whether I should publish notes about a book that has been so controversial. In my opinion, this book is a work of art. Obviously not because of its depiction of sexual abuse and rape, but how the book makes us side with the perpretator. 

The way the main protagonist, Humbert Humbert, is portrayed in this book leaves the reader in a moral dilemma. 

He is well-spoken, appears to be well-mannered and educated. He meets Lolita (nickname for Dolores), a young girl with whom he falls in love. He will subsequently marry her mother - just to be closer to Lolita. 

The reader knows that his actions are morally wrong: he sneakily tries to find new ways to get closer to Lolita, scheming his way into her live which she doesn't stop, but mostly because she is a child and unaware of the power imbalances that this relationship brings with it (later in the book, Lolita is well aware of the fact that he is abusing her, but plays along). 

Nabokov however portrays Humbert almost as a victim - a victim of his own sexual fantasies that he is not able to succumb. What else can he do when he is so in love with this child?

The reader cannot escape - we are trapped in Humbert's own reality, trying to find new ways to get satisfaction, that his needs are met, and we secretly hope that everything goes according to his plans. Lolita doesn't seem to like it but we root for Humbert.

Writing a novel about this sensitive and morally wrong topic is one thing, but twisting the story in such ways that we are siding with the perpetrator is an act of genius on Nabokov's side.
