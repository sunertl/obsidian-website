### To Read

> tsundoku (積ん読) is the phenomenon of acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them.

I take notes which books my friends feel so strongly about that I just have to read them. I wish I had more time - or at least the proclivity to prioritize reading over anything else. Below is a list of books that I own but haven't started reading it (*tsundoku*) or on my list to buy.
