## Introduction - Personal Connection

Photography is a hobby I picked up several years ago when I got (or maybe purchased myself?) a Canon EOS 1100D as my first [[DSLR]]. Over the years, I purchased a couple of [[Camera Lens||lenses]], did some decent shots when I was traveling (specifically to Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei) and was recently into it. 

With the raise of pretty good smartphone cameras, I didn't pick up my DSLR for a long time again, because due to ease of access and since I am carrying my phone with me all the time, I didn't see much of a reason to carry a bulky camera with me.

I recently changed my perspective on that - this was mostly driven by my [[Happiness|desire to pursue hobbies to increase my happiness]].
