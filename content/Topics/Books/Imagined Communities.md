- [[Nationalism manifests itself in the cultural systems that preceded it]]
- [[The slow, uneven decline of interlinked certainties laid the foundation of new ways of linking fraternity, power and time meaningful together]]
- [[The convergence of capitalism and print technology created the possibility of a new form of imagined community, which set the stage for the modern nation.]]
	- [[Print-capitalism made it possible for a growing number of people to think about themselves and to relate themselves to others]]
	- [[Print-languages laid the bases for national consciousness]]
