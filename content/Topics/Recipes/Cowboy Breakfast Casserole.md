## Ingredients

12–15 servings

### For the casserole:

7 slices white sandwich bread

1 pound bulk breakfast sausage

Softened unsalted butter or nonstick vegetable cooking spray (for pan)

4 scallions, white and pale green and dark green parts separated, thinly sliced

1 (10-ounce) package frozen spinach, thawed, squeezed dry

8 ounces cheddar cheese, shredded (about 2 cups)

8 large eggs

1 1/2 cups milk

1/2 cup full-fat Greek yogurt

1 teaspoon mustard powder

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg


## Directions

#### Step 1
Preheat oven to 425°F. Toast bread on a rimmed baking sheet until dry, 8–10 minutes.
#### Step 2  
Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add sausage and cook, breaking into pieces with a spatula, until browned, about 7 minutes.
    
    #### Step 3
    
    Butter a 3-quart baking dish. Arrange 6 bread slices in dish in one layer, covering bottom of pan completely and cutting slices to fit if needed. Tear remaining slice into smaller pieces to fill in any gaps.
    
    #### Step 4
    
    Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to baking dish, scattering over bread.
    
    #### Step 5
    
    Heat skillet over medium and add white and pale green scallion parts. Cook, stirring, until softened and just starting to take on color, about 3 minutes. Add spinach, stir to combine, and cook until warmed through, 1–2 minutes more. Top sausage with spinach mixture, then top spinach mixture with cheese.
    
    #### Step 6
    
    Whisk eggs, milk, yogurt, mustard powder, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Gently pour over casserole. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or up to overnight.
    
    #### Step 7
    
    Uncover dish and transfer to a cold oven. Heat oven to 375°F and bake casserole until eggs are puffed and cheese is browned, about 40 minutes.
    
    #### Step 8
    
    Let casserole cool several minutes. Top with dark green scallion parts.
