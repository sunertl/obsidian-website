- 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped, divided
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
- 1 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste and for garnish

## Directions

- Divide risotto and meatballs among bowls. Drizzle with oil; garnish with additional cheese, parsley, and pepper.

## Notes

- Keep the meatballs in the oven so they'll stay warm when the risotto is ready 
- Risotto with meatballs just doesn't seem to fully work - it makes the dish very heavy
