## Personal Notes

Relieved to have finally seen this movie - it has been recommended to me for several years and I am glad that I finally had the chance to watch it. A masterpiece! Acting, cinematography was outstanding. There were scenes in the movie that captured the moral pressure of Mr. Gondo: when at his house, the police and everyone else, was in the same shot while he argued with himself whether to release funds to the kidnapper. He had a monologue and everyone else was looking down, with their heads towards the ground - adding to the scene the moral pressure Mr. Gondo must have felt. Everyone was expecting him to do the right thing. This 'technique' is called [[Blocking]]

The hunt for the kidnapper was long (almost an hour long) but never dull. It was a fantastic build up, the connection with drugs was also sublime.

The movie is called High and Low - my take is that it symbolized a lot class conflict in Japan during that time. The kidnapper's motive was that he felt envious about Mr. Gondo's life. A beautiful home, warm, etc., everything the kidnapper didn't have.
