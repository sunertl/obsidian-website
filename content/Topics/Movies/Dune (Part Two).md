## Synopsis

Paul Atreides unites with Chani and the Fremen while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family.

## Personal Notes

A perfect (soft) science-fiction movie that captivated me the entire time. While Villeneuve took some liberties and deviated from the book, I appreciate that it was as close to the book as possible.
