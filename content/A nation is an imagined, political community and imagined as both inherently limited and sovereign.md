**Why is it imagined?**
Because the people of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion.

**Why is it limited?**
It is imagined as limited because even the largest nations have finite boundaries beyond which lie other nations.

**Why is it sovereign?**
The concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchical dynastic realm. 

**Why is it a community?**
It is always imagined/conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship.
