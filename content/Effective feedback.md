**Foundation**

There are certain principles when giving effective feedback:

- expectations need to be defined at the beginning of the project because they lay the foundation for effective feedback in the future ([[Project planning]])
- feedback needs to be fact-based and never personal
	- behavior feedback can however add value since it shows how others perceive them and can improve the person's performance
- feedback should be given through multiple perspectives
- make them feel safe ([[Authentic leadership]])
- feedback needs to be shared (preferably in an email after a 1:1)
- needs to be specific as possible / clarify what success looks like
- critical feedback needs to be delivered directly and dispassionately
